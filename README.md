# Game Price Checker ðŸ’µ

## Requirements

- macOS operating system.
- AppleScript is pre-installed on macOS and doesn't require additional installations.

## How to Use

## Limitations

- The script uses basic shell commands and regular expressions, which might not handle all possible web page structures or API responses. Some pages may require additional parsing logic.
